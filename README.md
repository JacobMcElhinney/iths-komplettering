**Instruction:** Fork this repository. Create a Pull request once you are ready to merge your changes

## 

## Part 1: Git, GitHub Issues & Projects

## Prerequisite
Before you get started, complete the git [exercises](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_exercises.asp?remote=github) and [quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_quiz.asp?remote=github) on w3schools.com. I want proof of completion so that I can assert that you have a basic knowledge of git. Either take screenshots of your results directly orintegrate the results with LinkedIn, then take screenshots and email me/send to me on Teams to verify that you completed both tasks. 

>**Note**
>In order to complete these steps you will have to first complete the git [tutorial on Wc3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp) which is part of your assignment. This instruction tests your understanding of the concepts explained in the tutorial section "Git Contribute".  

- [ ] Fork this repository: In top right corner click on: `Fork > Create a new fork`
- [ ] In your forked repository, open `index.html`.
- [ ] Add a new list item with a link to **a separate** repository which you later will use to demonstrate you knowledge of how to use [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart) and [Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects), just like in the example below:
  ```html
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/JacobMcElhinney/iths-projekt-i-team/issues">Jacob's example repository</a></li>
  ```
  I will use the link to access your repository (make it public or make me a contributor) to review your GitHub Issues & project.
- [ ] Once you've read the quick start guide on GitHub issues & projects you have to use your newly attained knowledge of how to split Epics into User Stories. Please refer to `Föreläsning 3` on `ITHS distans`. Here is my [simple example](https://github.com/JacobMcElhinney/iths-projekt-i-team/issues) to point you in the right direction
- [ ] Add a *Project* to your Repo and use it to organise your issues as if you were planning for the next sprint iteration, to demonstrate a basic understanding of how GitHub projects work.
- [ ] Once you have used GitHub Issues to create at least one Epic and split it into at least two User stories: Create a new Pull Request and to merge your changes into this repository. 
- [ ] You have now demonstrated that you know how to fork, create a pull request and contribute to an open-source project. Thank you for your contribution :smiley:

## Part 2: Trello

**Getting started**
- [ ] Use [this trello template](https://trello.com/templates/engineering/scrum-board-dFzygb01) to create a Scrum Board by clicking on "Use Template"
- [ ] Reference the Presentations (especially "Föreläsning 3") on "ITHS Distans kursum" go get started with agile project management, Scrum and Trello.

**Scrum Board**
Pretend we are mid-sprint during the second sprint iteration of our scrum project. Use the Epic (at least one) and User Stories (at least two) and add the to you Trello Scrum board (use the powerup GitHub integration option OR recreate them using complete Trello cards). 
Put at least one of your User stories in the Done state (List in Trello)
